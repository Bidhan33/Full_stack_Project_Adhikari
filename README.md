Student Management System

Project Overview:


This project is a comprehensive Student Management System designed to streamline the process of managing student records. Developed using a combination of Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL technologies, it offers a robust solution for educational institutions to efficiently handle student data.

Database Setup:

The foundation of the system lies in its SQL database, which stores student information securely. To set up the database, a new database named "StudentDB" is created, and demo data is added using SQL queries. The database schema includes tables for student records, storing data such as student name, age, and grade. This ensures that the system is equipped with a solid backend infrastructure to manage student information effectively.


Java Backend:

The backend logic of the system is implemented using Java. Key components include the StudentDAO (Data Access Object) class, responsible for database operations, and the StudentServlet class, which handles HTTP requests and responses. The StudentDAO class encapsulates methods for connecting to the database, executing SQL queries, and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student records. Meanwhile, the StudentServlet class serves as the intermediary between the frontend interface and the database, ensuring seamless communication and data retrieval.


Frontend Interface:
The frontend of the system is designed to provide a user-friendly experience. It comprises HTML files for structuring the interface, CSS for styling elements, and JavaScript for adding interactivity. The main interface features intuitive buttons for common operations such as adding, updating, and deleting student records. Additionally, the interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal usability across various devices and screen sizes.

Features:
Student Record Management: Users can effortlessly manage student records, including adding new students, updating existing records, and deleting outdated information.
Interactive Interface: The frontend interface is equipped with interactive elements, allowing users to perform actions with ease. Buttons for common operations are prominently displayed, enhancing user accessibility and workflow efficiency.
Database Interaction: Through the use of Java servlets, the system seamlessly interacts with the SQL database, facilitating smooth data retrieval and manipulation. The implementation of doGet and doPost methods ensures efficient handling of HTTP requests and responses, enabling real-time updates to student records.
